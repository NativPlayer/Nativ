# Nativ

### WARNING
> Nativ is in a highly alpha state right now and entire details will most definitely change, the below is a psuedo-roadmap of what the project hopes to support. 

Nativ is a cross-platform media browsing service that intends to support a wide variety of content, from the videos of Youtube to the micro-blogging of Twitter. 
It achieves this by interacting with a mixture of public and private apis to esentially make a full fledged client for these services.

It also supports a server architechture that can fetch all this content for a variety of users, and through this feature it intends to allow media providers (Youtube, Twitter, TikTok, etc.) to create their own endpoints for the service so they can support the app **nativ**ely.
